We need to find MMP(R,i,G): the longest substring (R_i, ..., R_{i + MML - 1})
that matches exactly one or more substrings of G. The algorithm finds the MMP 
starting from the first base of the read. We do not find all possible MEM, but
sequentially from the beginning toward the end of a read. 
memc is a C version of mem with this feature of sequential search of G for 
substrings in R.
