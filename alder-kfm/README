# Goal
This is an implementation of color kfm; a combination of Rodland's kfm and 
cortex's label. It may be too ambitious, but the goal is to infer evolutionary
events from HTS data of multiple individuals. This could be an isolation model,
or isolation-with-migration model when two populations are considered. It could
infer parsimony trees from multiple populations. To this end, two more fields
are added to the traditional kfm by Rodland; individual labels in one bit per
individual or population, and coverage levels in one more more bits. Having 
integer values for the number of kmers seems to be overkill if these values 
could have been ordered factor or digitized. This could allow billion nodes
in de Bruijn graph.

# 40 chimpanzees
I aim to analyze a HTS data set of 40 chimpanzees in 50GB RAM and 1TB SSD disk
machine to infer evolutionary events of those 40 individuals; split events
and migration.

# kfm
This goal suggests that the name of the project could be different from kfm.
alder-im - it is too narrow.
alder-tree - too broad
alder-hey - could be one.

# Roadmap
Convert a set of sequence files to a kfm file.
Use a kfm file to count kmer using alder-kmer.
Use a kfm file or features of alder-kfm to assemble genomes or transcriptomes
with alder-debruijn.

alder-denovo would use a de Bruijn method and others for assembling genomes or
transcriptomes.

# Procedure

1. Create an input file for kfm.
population names
individual names
sequences from individuals

2.
