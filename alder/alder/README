Features of alder
-----------------
1. Allow a single project only.
2. Load fastq files.
3. Specify factors such as condition and type.
4. Specify a reference genome.
5. Specify one of the genome annotations available for the reference genome.
6. Select a short read aligner.
7. Choose options of the aligner.
8. Select a differential expression statistical tool.
9. Choose options of the statistical tool.
10. Choose options of computing resources (CR).
11. Provide CR: a single machine, machines shared with, cloud, and other HPC.
12. Provide preprocessing of fastq files.
13. Preprocessing includes cleaning adapters, quality score distribution, etc.

Sketch of Graphical User Interface
----------------------------------
1. A single simple window with navigation of swiping back and forth.
2. Summary of analysis settings, and modification of settings.
3. Summary of the analysis.
4. Progress of the analysis.
5. Like the window interface of a software step-by-step installation.
6. A welcome window and a startup window.

Alder Files
-----------
I need to keep several files with information necessary to save and load an 
alder (ald) project file. This file contains:
1. FASTQ files
2. Preprocessing options.
3. Alignment options.
4. DE options.
5. Reference genome and its annotation link.
6. Differential expression results.
7. Summary of preprocessing result.
8. Summary of alignment result.
The file size should be reasonably small (less than 10MB).

Key implementation
------------------
.Document-based core data application
.NSWindowController (App Delegation?)
.xcode-like GUI (toolbar, splitview)
.menus on the left view of the splitview
.configuration (Fastq and Analysis)
