Basic Installation using CMake
==============================

   The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `cmake' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `cmake' might take a while.  While running, it prints
     some messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make test' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
     privileges.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  

  6. We do not have a way to uninstall the package. Just delete the binary
     file that is installed. They are usually installed in /usr/local/bin,
     and the executable name is alder-kmer. 

Compilers and Options
=====================

   You can give `cmake' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`cmake' the option `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
absolute file name.

Distribution
============

   I can use `cpack' for making a distribution of alder-kmer. Follow these steps,
     $ mkdir build
     $ cmake ..
     $ make
     $ cpack --config CPackSourceConfig.cmake
VERSION_PATCH is not working. I had to manually edit `CPackSourceConfig.cmake',
and use `sh/dist' script instead.

Upload it to bitbucket website, https://bitbucket.org/goshng/alder/downloads,
then edit homebrew package file.
     $ brew edit alder
