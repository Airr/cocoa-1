# Introduction
I will introduce a method for counting k-mer with arbitrary size of k by
combining methods of Rizk et al. (2013), and Marcais and Kingsford (2011). 
The point of the paper is the usage of multi-word CAS in counting k-mer.

# Procedure
1. Read a file in format of sequence only text file, fasta, fastq.
2. Read k-mer one at a time, and count the number of k-mer.
3. Report the count of k-mer.

# Features

Faster processing with less memory.

1. U Hash Table for overflow, and reduce the size of value type 
   to 1 or 2 bytes, or even variable size.

## bit-packed data
Count numbers may be small or variable in size. They could be bit-packed as 
well. Some of k-mers occur more often than others. Some of them occur extremely
often, and many others occur only once.

## Arbitrary k-mer with multi-word CAS

## Effective use of CPU cores

# Uses
gzip for compression
CAS instruction
Constant memory and hard dirve usage
Binary matrix multiplication - Am for f(m) the hash function.
Random invertible matrix multiplication
memory, cpu, hard drive stats.

# Questions
1. What if I know the distribution of keys? This may not make sense because
   I would have the count data after counting was finished.

# GCC function for CAS
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.3.5/gcc/Atomic-Builtins.html#Atomic-Builtins

# Unix command
To count A,C,G,T in a file
grep -o . a-00.seq | sort | uniq -ic

# Retired options

option "number-kmers" - "Number of kmers" long typestr="number" default="10" optional
details="The maximum number of kmers and effectively the length of a long sequence.
The maximum value is 9223372036854775807 because of its long type."
