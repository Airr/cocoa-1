/******************************************************************************
 
 This document describes KFM, a file format for KFM index. I'd follow the 
 PNG file format described in http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/. I also copy text 
 thereof.
 
 1. KFM signature
 
 The first eight bytes of a KFM datastream contain the following decimal 
 values:
 137 75 70 77 13 10 26 10
 This signature indicates that the remainder of the datastream contains a
 single KFM index, consisting of a series of chunks beginning with an IHDR
 chunk and ending with an IEND chunk.
 I reserve 24 bytes for futre use. Total 32 bytes in the KFM signature are 
 reserved.

 2. Chunk Layout

 Each chunk consists of four fields:
 Length Type Data CRC

 Length is the 64-bit unsigned integer; eight-byte unsigned integer giving the
 number of bytes in the chunk's data field. The length counts only the data
 field, not itself, the chunk type, or the CRC. Zero is a valid length.

 Type is a series of four bytes defining the chunk type. 

 Data is a serise of bytes appropriate to the chunk type, if any. This field
 can be of zero length.

 CRC four-byte CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Code) calculated on the preceding bytes
 in the chunk, including the chunk type field and chunk data fields, but not
 including the length field. The CRC can be used to check for corruption of
 the data. The CRC is always present, even for chunks containing no data. 

 3. IHDR chunk

 The four-byte chunk type field contains the decimal values
 73, 72, 68, 82
 The IHDR chunk shall be the first chunk in the KFM datastream, containing:
 KFM index order | 4 byte
 KFM index size  | 8 bytes
 KFM rho size    | 8 bytes
 rho step size   | 8 bytes
 
 4. IKFM chunk

 The four-byte chunk type field contains the decimal values
 73, 75, 70, 77
 The IKFM chunk contains (3*8 + V x 8):
 Number of item bits  | 8 bytes
 Number of items      | 8 bytes
 Number of values (V) | 8 bytes
 DATA                 | V x 8
 
 5. IRHO chunk

 The four-byte chunk type field contains the decimal values
 73, 82, 72, 79
 The IKFM chunk contains (2 x 8 + 2 x longsize x 8 + 3 x 8 + V x 8):
 Number of items      | 8 bytes
 maxstep              | 8 bytes
 increments           | longsize x 8 bytes
 stored               | longsize x 8 bytes
 Number of item bits  | 8 bytes
 Number of items      | 8 bytes
 Number of values (V) | 8 bytes
 DATA                 | V x 8

 6. IEND chunk
 
 The four-byte chunk type field contains the decimal values
 73, 69, 78, 68
 The IEND chunk marks the end of the KFM datastream. 
 The chunk's data field is empty.
