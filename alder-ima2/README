# Note
I have found out that ima2 went to C++ in someway. This would not be compiled because this is a C project. I justed changed the file names in ima2 directory from cpp to c (hpp to h). There are many compilation errors in this project.

# Projects
Find ima2 project for the successfully compiled C++ version of ima2.

# Version
ima2-8.27.12
