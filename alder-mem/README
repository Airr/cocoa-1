We call a region of size being L "L-window" where L is the size of the read.
0. alder_mem functions allow me to have a list of anchors or matches.
1. Find L-windows from anchors. A match or anchor has q, r, and l. 
   q is the 0-based position of the match in the query sequence.
   r is the 0-based position of the match in the reference sequence.
   l is the length of the match.
   The L-window for a match starts at r - q and ends in r - q + L, or
   L-window is [r-q,r-q+L). 
2. Take the union of the L-windows.
3. Assign matches or anchors to the L-windows.
4. Filter L-windows that any of the matches in the L-window are not consecutive.
5. Use each L-window to perform a pairwise alignment.
