Power of 2 Hash Table Size

Programmer uses hash table size that is power of 2 because address calculation can be performed very quickly. The integer hash function can be used to post condition the output of a marginal quality hash function before the final address calculation is done.

addr = inthash(marginal_hash_value) & (tablesize - 1);
Using the inlined version of the integer hash function is faster than doing a remaindering operation with a prime number! An integer remainder operation may take up to 18 cycles or longer to complete, depending on machine architecture.
