A rough procedure of the alignment
----------------------------------
1. Build a suffix array from a genome in FASTA format.
2. Repeat the alignment of each read in the RNA-seq data.
3. Locate MEMs for each of the read in the data on the genome using the suffix array.
4. Locate regions in the genome to perform pairwise alignment between the genome and the read.
5. Perform the pairwise alignment using Dialign.
6. Output the result in SAM file.
